        <p class="textdis">Burabay, the resort pearl of Kazakhstan, is a fantastic mountain land harboring mysterious wonders. Gorgeous pine forests, cliffs formed of neat gigantic natural bricks, and fantastical shapes of peaks resembling sometimes exotic, sometimes Egyptian
            pointed pyramids separated by serene lakes. Although Burabay Park does not have any artifacts on its territory, every rock here has its own legend. The SNNP “Burabay” was established in August, 2000 and it is under the supervision of the Administration
            of Presidential Affairs. <br><br> The territory of SNNP “Burabai” is a part of the Kokshetau steppe, a mixed steppe and forest and hilly upland. The climate is extreme continental here, with hot summers and severe winters. The topography of
            the territory consists of lowlands, hills and plains. <br><br>There are many legends and stories about Borovoye. “When God was creating the world, one of the nations received the lands rich of forests, another got fertile fields with large
            rivers, and the third got the beautiful mountains and blue lakes. But the Kazakh ended up with only feather-grass steppe… This offended him and he asked God to endow him with some natural beauty. God took the mountains, rocks, beautiful pine
            and deciduous forests, blue lakes with pure water, and emerald fields covered with grasses and flowers from his korzhyn and spread them with a bountiful hand into the boundless steppes. It was the appearance of Borovoye; of one of the most
            picturesque places in Kazakhstan, which for its beauty and rare harmonic combination of mountains, forests, lakes, and unique flora and fauna received the poetic name “The pearl of Kazakhstan”.</p>

        <img class="imgbm" width="800" src="css/img/burabay2.png" alt="">
        <p class="textdis">Borovoye is also the name of a health resort, which is situated in the Shuchinsky district of Kokshetau Region, 20 km from the station of Borovoye Resort (in the town of Shuchinsk). From the north it is surrounded by the Kokshetau Mountains at
            a height of 974m above sea level, covered with birch forests. In the neighboring of the resort are such interesting rocks and cliffs as: “Okzhetpes”, “Sphinx”, “Cow”, “Sleeping knight”, and “Knight”. The first private health resort was opened
            here in 1910. Average temperature in January is -16’C, in July is +19’C. Atmospheric precipitation is up to 400 mm, with about 2000 sunny hours per year. The main medicinal remedies here are fresh air and picturesque views. <br><br> A mysterious
            rock in the middle of Lake Boroboe in Northern part of Kazakhstan. Legend has it that the army of Ablai Khan took an Oirat princess captive and forced her to marry a Kazakh warrior. She fell deeply in love with one warrior but the others were
            jealous. So she said that she would marry the man who could shoot to the top of a rock outcrop near the lake. All failed the first time, but her love hit it on the second try. The rivals killed him so she flung herself in the lake and became
            Zhumbaktas (Mysterious Stone).
        </p>
        <img class="imgbm2" width="800" src="css/img/bu2.png" alt="">
        <p class="textdis">One can not be help but mention the lakes of Borovoye. There are many. Lakes Shychie, Borovoye, Big and Small Chebachie, and Koturkul glitter on the green atlas of the forest.The small lakes Svetloye, Karasye, Gornoye, Lebedinoye can be seen from
            the Kokchetau Cliffs. The visiting card of Borovoye is the Blue Bay on the lake of the same name. Right out of the waters of the bay, Mount Zhumbaktas (Mystery, Sphinx) soars. <br><br> The park counts 757 sorts of plants, of which 119 should
            be protected, and 12 are registered in the Red Book. The forest has 65% of pines, 31% of birches, 3% of aspens and 1% of shrubs. Many species of edible mushrooms can be found. Due to the diversity of the flora, the fauna is very abundant:
            305 species of animals can be found, which represents 36% of the fauna diversity of Kazakhstan. 40% of them live at the border of their habitat, and 13 species are registered in the Red Book. <br><br> The wildlife of Burabay is much richer
            than that of the surrounding steppes. There species from steppes, forests and mountains mix. Some Europe-wide species are found as well as Siberian, Southern and Northern ones.Currently, Burabay's forests host a variety of deer including roe
            deer, moose, wild boar, squirrels, stoats, weasel and marten. Amongst the predators, wolves and lynx might be encountered. In the steppes and wooded areas, fox species, weasels and European and mountain hares might be met with, as well as
            badgers in the forests.There are a variety of birds, particularly ducks and waders which include common goldeneye, mallard, gadwall, northern pintail, ruddy shelducks, plovers, northern lapwings, common sandpipers, green sandpipers. Ducks
            numbers rise massively during Autumn and during migration periods.In the dry stony pine forests, and along the forests, the birch wooden steppes, the grey partridge and the capercailie can be found.
